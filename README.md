# AI-Powered-YouTube-Notes-Generator-and-Semantic-QA-System
Technologies: Python, Streamlit, Gemini AI, ChromaDB, YouTubeTranscriptAPI

Developed and deployed an end-to-end app for transforming video content into searchable text knowledge using Streamlit, Gemini AI, and ChromaDB.

Created modular, object-oriented backend logic in Python for video processing, transcript extraction, note generation, and vector DB management.

Used the Google Generative AI SDK, .env secrets, and file I/O caching to build a reliable and reproducible pipeline.

Engineered an NLP pipeline that extracts transcripts from YouTube videos and uses LLMs (Gemini) to summarize them into concise, bullet-point notes.

Applied prompt engineering and LLM-based reasoning to build a Q&A system over a custom knowledge base using ChromaDB vector retrieval.
