This video provides a three-part guide to relieving one-sided lower back pain at home without equipment.

**Part 1: Relieving Muscle Tightness**

*   Use a tennis ball (or rolled-up socks) to self-massage tight muscles in the lower back.
*   Lie on your back with knees bent at 90 degrees, feet flat against a door for stability.
*   Place the ball on a tender spot, lifting your hips to control pressure.
*   Roll the ball side-to-side, or experiment with forward/backward or circular motions for 15-20 seconds per spot.  Repeat 3-5 times per spot.
*   For more focused pressure, tilt your pelvis towards the painful side.
*   Advanced techniques include adding pelvic tilts or bringing one knee to your chest while applying pressure.

**Part 2: Improving Mobility**

*   **Ballerina Stretch:** Stand tall, cross one leg in front of the other. Place your hand on the opposite hip, press into the hip to move your pelvis towards the painful side.  Reach your opposite arm overhead and bend sideways into the stretch. Hold for 20-60 seconds; 3-5 repetitions. This targets the QL muscle.
*   **Cobra & Child's Pose Combination:** Start on all fours (on bed or floor).  Rock back into Child's Pose (butt towards heels), holding for 20-30 seconds. Rock forward into Cobra Pose (arch your back, chest lifted), holding for 20-30 seconds. Repeat 3-5 times. To target one side, tilt your upper body towards the opposite side in both poses.

**Part 3: Dynamic Movements & Strengthening**

*   **Corkscrew Stretch:** Lie on your back with one leg straight, the other bent with foot on the inner thigh of the straight leg.  Press up with your upper body, then twist your body towards the bent knee. Hold for 20 seconds; 3-5 repetitions. For one-sided relief, laterally tilt your body towards the opposite side while twisting. This targets the piriformis and QL muscles.
*   **Butt Walk:** Lie on your back with legs straight, hands on your chest.  "Walk" your legs and buttocks, alternating sides, for about 5 seconds.  Repeat 3-5 times. This strengthens the glutes, core, and lower back muscles to improve balance and stability.


The video emphasizes that addressing muscle imbalances is key to long-term pain relief.
