easy to make with very simple
ingredients and it tastes great with
naan rotis or even phulkas so let's get
started and check it out
[Music]
for this recipe i've taken 400 grams of
fresh paneer just cut it into medium
sized cubes
so you can see it's a nice size it's not
too large or too small this is a good
size so we're just going to mix the
paneer pieces with some basic spice
powders starting with some turmeric
powder
a teaspoon of chili powder
just quarter teaspoon of pepper
and about half teaspoon of salt
so just mix everything
till all the pieces are just coated
[Music]
and we'll just let this sit
white kadai add about two tablespoons of
oil
and one tablespoon of ghee
so ghee is going to give you that nice
extra flavor to the dish
next add all the whole spices
cinnamon
cardamom
using the green and the black cardamom
cloves
star anise
shahi jeera 1 teaspoon
and bay leaf
next i'm adding two large onions that's
finely chopped
saute the onions till they're a nice
golden brown color
so you can see the onions have turned to
a lovely golden brown color now i'm
going to add a teaspoon of garlic paste
and one teaspoon of ginger paste
now i'm adding all the spice powder
starting with quarter teaspoon of
turmeric powder 2 teaspoons of kashmiri
red chilli powder
1 teaspoon cumin powder 1 teaspoon
coriander powder 2 teaspoons of besan
that is gram flour next add a teaspoon
of salt
just mix everything nicely
so we're just going to cook these
powders just for a few seconds
make sure you maintain the flame on a
low
next i'm adding the puree of six large
tomatoes
so this has to cook till all the raw
smell goes and it becomes nice and thick
and the oil begins to separate
so you can see how the tomato puree has
reduced beautifully the raw smell has
gone and you can see the oil all
separated now i'm going to add
one tablespoon of whisked curd
just mix it all in
now i'm going to add one teaspoon of
garam masala powder
next add a teaspoon of sugar
to balance the flavors
just mix that in
now that we've cooked all the raw masala
i'm going to add one cup of water to get
a nice gravy consistency just mix that
in if you need to add more water to get
the nice gravy consistency you can add a
little more
so let this cook for about five minutes
so next we're going to fry the paneer
pieces to a pan add a little ghee
you can also fry the paneer in a little
oil but i prefer ghee because the flavor
is better with ghee
[Music]
once you've roasted the paneer pieces
keep it aside
so you can see the gravy is coming
together so beautifully all the oil has
separated now final touches
